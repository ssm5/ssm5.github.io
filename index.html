                  <p>
                    2020 has been a bizzare year. The coronavirus pandemic brought
                    the entire world to a stand still. With cases and deaths rising to record-breaking
                    level, countries were forced to go into lockdown to fight the invisible enemy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the empty factories, and desserted roads cities around the world reported an
                    increase in air quality and reduce in smog.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It would be interesting to see how the world changed during these days, wouldn't it?

                <h1 class="mb-3">The Lockdowns</h1>
                <p>
                  Rapid rise in cases forced major countries to shutdown their borders and enforce a
                  string lockdown in major cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
                  For instance, Europe was one of the worst hit regions early on in the pandemic with countries
                  like Italy and Spain making the news consistently with their record breaking cases.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this visualization, we will see how environmental variables in three Italian cities: Rome, Florence, 
                  and Naples were affected. On the timeline below are some important dates on when Italian
                  lockdowns started and ended. These lines will persists in the graphs in the next few slides.

                <p>
                  pm25 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than
                  2.5 micrometers. Due to the lockdown, the particulate matter suspended in the air
                  reduced to levels less they were the same time in 2019. However, the particute
                  matter increased in the winter due to heavier in air and possibly increase in
                  activity after the lockdowns were lifted.

                  Similar to pm25, pm10 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than
                  1 micrometer. Due to the lockdown, the particulate matter suspended in the air
                  reduced to levels less they were the same time in 2019. However, the particute
                  matter increased in the winter due to heavier in air and possibly increase in

                <p>
                  NO2 is the amount of nitrogram dioxide in the atmospehere.
                  The downward trend right after the lockdown can be attributed
                  to reduce in cars on the roads.

                  Finally, the temperature seemed to be roughly the same in both years. Therefore,
                  no real temperature change can be attributed to the lockdowns.
